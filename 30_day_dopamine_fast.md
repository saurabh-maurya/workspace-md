# 30‑Day Dopamine Fasting Plan — Step‑by‑Step + Daily Checklist

**Goal:** Reset your reward system, build deep-focus habits, and regain control over compulsive stimulus-seeking.

**Principles (read once, follow always):**
- **Avoid** high‑frequency, low‑effort dopamine triggers: social media feeds, aimless YouTube/OTT binging, excessive gaming, compulsive shopping, porn, and junk food/snack binges.
- **Replace** removed behaviors with slow, effortful rewards: reading, creative work, conversation, exercise, learning.
- **Be strict when you need to be — forgiving when you slip.** Short relapses are data, not failure.

## Quick Daily Structure (same every day)
1. **Morning ritual (30–60 min)**: Wake, hydrate, 10–20 min meditation, quick journaling (3 things grateful for + today’s focus), sunlight exposure/walk.
2. **Focused work block(s)**: 1–3 blocks of deep work (45–120 min). Single-tasking only.
3. **Movement**: 20–45 min workout/walk/yoga daily.
4. **Learning / Slow reward**: 20–60 min reading or practicing a skill.
5. **No‑screens window**: 1–4 hours of the day entirely phone/computer free (besides necessary work tools).
6. **Evening wind‑down**: No screens 60–90 min before bed, journaling (what went well, what pulled me), sleep by target time.

## Closing — small pep talk
This is a skill training program, not punishment. The first week is the hardest; growth happens after you persist through discomfort. Keep the checklist close, be honest in your journal, and tune the plan to your life.
